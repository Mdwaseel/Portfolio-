<h1 align="center">Portfolio Webpage</h1>
<h4>• About the Page :- Creating my first portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS was a challenging yet rewarding experience.I started by researching and sketching out different designs and layouts for my webpage on figma, and then wrote the HTML code to structure the content. Next, I used CSS to style the layout and visual design of my webpage, including colors, fonts, and images.<br>
Throughout the process, I faced challenges such as aligning and positioning different elements, ensuring mobile-friendliness, and browser compatibility.However, I overcame these challenges through experimentation and feedback from peers and mentors.<br>
After completing my portfolio webpage, I published it on Github to showcase my work to a wider audience and receive feedback.This allowed me to gain experience in using Github and deploying webpages online, as well as develop my design, problem-solving, and foundational web development skills.<br>
In conclusion, creating my first portfolio webpage using only HTML and CSS was an excellent learning experience that taught me the importance of planning, experimentation, collaboration, and problem-solving in web development. It also helped me develop foundational skills in web development, design, and user experience. I am excited to continue building more webpages and projects in the future..</h4>
